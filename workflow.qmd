## My Workflow

This page describes my workflow.

### Data wrangling

Data can be found on the MLIT Dataset : https://www.reinfolib.mlit.go.jp/realEstatePrices/. It contains all the real estates price transactions all over Japan since 2003.

```{r}
# Load libraries
library(ggplot2)
```

### Data cleaning

Perform your analysis here.

```{r}
# Example plot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Car Weight vs MPG")
```

### Analysis

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```


Document your findings and conclusions.
